        <p>Spiritfarer is an indie adventure game developed by Thunder Lotus Games, where the player must meet the needs of the spirits aboard their ship with foods and building boat additions.<br></p> <p>This leads to the player collecting materials while on their journey to build kitchens, gardens, and other home amenities to help the spirits feel more at home.<br></p> <p>While uncovering more of each spirit's backstory, they sail their way to crossing over to the afterlife through the Everdoor.<br> </p> <p>These new sections that are added to the ship are placed like puzzle pieces, stacked up on top of one another in any way that fits.<br></p> <p>The characters that Stella meets along the way also give the player mini-games to play for materials and in-game currency that are relevant to the spirit's character. <br></p> <p>The game also has vendors that sell items such as seeds for the player's gardens, and furniture to decorate their ship, giving the game a more personalized experience.</p>
