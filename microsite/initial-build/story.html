        <p>The game begins as you take on the role of Stella, the new 'Spiritfarer' who is tasked with taking the spirits of people who have died through to the afterlife.

          To accomplish this task, and accompanied by Stella's pet cat Daffodil, you travel by boat between various islands. Whenever you meet a new spirit, they join you on the boat and give you various tasks to complete. What these tasks are depend on the individual spirit's backstory but include things like talking to particular people, building a specific room or upgrade on the boat or collect resources for them.
          
          A large part of the game is getting to know each spirit, and keeping them happy with chatting, food and the occasional hug. It doesn't take long after meeting the first spirit you encounter, Gwen, for this connection to set in, and when it is time to say goodbye, it makes it all the harder.</p>
