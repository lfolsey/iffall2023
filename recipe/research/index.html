            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <p>

            <h4>Sweet potato (1 pound):</h4> This recipe calls for a pound of whole sweet potatoes. Fresh produce will give you the deepest, richest flavor. If you're in a rush, you can substitute canned sweet potatoes (just be sure to drain them first).<br>

            <h4>Butter (1/2 Cup):</h4> Like so many baked goods, butter is essential to sweet potato pie. It adds moisture, flavor, and texture to the custard filling.<br>

            <h4>Sugar (1 Cup):</h4> Obviously, granulated sugar adds sweetness. It also helps keep the pie filling soft by locking in moisture.<br>

            <h4>Milk (1/2 Cup):</h4> Whole milk serves as the liquid base that's essential for dissolving the dry ingredients and creating a cohesive filling. It also adds creamy flavor and texture.<br>

            <h4>2 Eggs:</h4> Traditional sweet potato pie has a custard filling, which means the filling relies on eggs (particularly the yolks) to bind the ingredients together. Make sure to allow the eggs to come to room temperature before incorporating them into the mixture.<br>

            <h4>Cinnamon (1/2 Tsp), Nutmeg (1/2 Tsp), and Vanilla (1 Tsp):</h4> Vanilla extract and warming spices like cinnamon and nutmeg are responsible for the cozy flavor that you likely associate with sweet potato pie. For extra flavor, consider adding a touch of ginger or allspice.<br>

            <h4>Unbaked Pie Crust:</h4> Use our top-rated Butter Flaky Pie Crust for guaranteed delicious results. Of course, a frozen or refrigerated crust will work in a pinch.<br>
